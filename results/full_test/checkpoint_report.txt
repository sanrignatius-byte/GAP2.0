GAP 2.0 Phase 1 — Checkpoint Evaluation Report
======================================================================

--- CHECKPOINT 1: Modality Cliff Causes Real Performance Failures ---
  Cliff boundary: layer 23
  Hard EVD (mean): 24.5
  Easy EVD (mean): 20.8
  EVD gap (hard - easy): 3.6 layers

--- CHECKPOINT 2: EVD Correlates with Downstream Performance ---
  [Full per-sample correlation requires running evd_performance_correlation()]
  Proxy check: EVD differs between task difficulty levels
  ✓ Positive signal: Hard tasks have higher EVD

--- CHECKPOINT 3: Geometric Collapse is Observable ---
  Visual ER post/pre ratio: 1.094 (want <0.7)
  Text ER post/pre ratio: 1.633 (want >0.85)
  Visual ICC change: +0.173 (want positive)
  CKA change: +0.008 (want positive)
  ⚠ MARGINAL (2/4 criteria met)
